# AI search
This project reranks google search results using an LLM using selenium.
### Running
1. Install requirements.txt
2. Make sure you have firefox installed on your computer
3. Run app.py
4. After you enter your query, there will be a delay until the google page pops up. You will probably be forced to solve a captcha. 
5. Selenium will browse all relevant websites, so you can just let it do its thing. Once it is done, it will display the links on the web page.
